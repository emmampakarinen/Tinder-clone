# Advanced Web Programming project

In this school project the task was to implement a *tinder clone* web application. The web application had
to include letting users register and letting authenticated users send likes and message each other. I
created the UI of the system with **React** and **MUI**, backend was implemented with 
**Express**, and database was implemented with **MongoDB**.

Installation: 
Make sure you have Node.js, nodemon and MongoDB accessible for the computer where you want
to run the app.
After installing the project, run “npm install” both in client-folder and server-folder and also
on the root (project)-folder on the terminal. After that run the start script on the terminal at the
root: “npm run dev”.
